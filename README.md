Getting Started with Predictive Modelling
======

A few weeks ago, I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and was looking for a place where I could apply the knowledge i gained to improve my skills.

Recently, I started competing on Kaggle and realized that there are very few practical machine learning guides available on the internet. I plan to create an open-source project where people can read other's well commented and explained code for various competitions and other datasets.

Currently, this repository contains code snippets I have written while participating in a few kaggle competitions. I plan to work on it full time in December so that it could help people like me become better at machine learning and predictive modelling.
